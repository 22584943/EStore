Authentication and password hashing using BCrypt (more secure than MD5 - found good utility code)
partial search matching products
project backed up with git
total cost on checkout screen - formatted prices to same x.xx format

create basket table, to keep hold of basket
customer class to do - get back from db, split by "," DONE
